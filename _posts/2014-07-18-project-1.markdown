description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 4<sup>th</sup> most common cancer in the UK and the 3<sup>rd</sup> leading cause of cancer deaths. A subset of BCTs, white blood cell (WBC) counts, have been associated with risk and mortality of CRC. In this project, I used a method in genetic epidemiology called <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/32/1/1/642797">Mendelian randomization</a> to estimate causal effects of the five WBC count subtypes (e.g. basophil count) on CRC risk. Additionally, I conducted a cohort analyis using the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a> dataset to study the association between WBC count and CRC risk. Both analyses showed agreement for higher eosinophil count having a protective effect on CRC risk. More information is available on the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.03.23286764v1">MedRxiv pre-print</a>.
