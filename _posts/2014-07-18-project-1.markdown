description: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women in the UK. It is also one of the most preventable. Immune cell counts (i.e. neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes and lymphocytes) have been found to affect the risk and mortality of BC. These cells are measured in routine blood tests, making them good to focus on to improve health outcomes for many people. I gathered data on these traits from the large-scale study called <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a>. I am using <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/32/1/1/642797">Mendelian randomization</a> and observational analyses to study the relationship between immune cell counts and BC risk.
