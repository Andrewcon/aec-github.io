description: During my time working with <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a> (UKBB) and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/32/1/1/642797">Mendelian randomization</a> (MR), I compiled many functions which made my work easier. I decided to convert these into a package called 'ukbbmr', which takes phenotypic and genetic data as inputs to perform one-sample MR analyses between traits of interest. Multi-threaded support was added to improve performance. Link to the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/andrewcon/ukbbmr">here</a>.
