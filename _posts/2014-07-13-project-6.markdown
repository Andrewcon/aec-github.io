description: I secured funding from the Medical Research Council to do a post-doc project at the University of Oxford's <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/7">Big Data Institute</a> starting 1 May 2023. I am working along with <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/benjamin-schuster-bockler-1">Ben</a>, with whom I am trying to explore the relationship between body mass index and risk of developing oesophageal cancer adenocarcinoma. While this relationship is well-known, the intermediate biological pathways have not been investigated. I am using a combined observational and genetic epidemiology approach i.e. statistical modelling using <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a> data and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/32/1/1/642797">Mendelian randomization</a> with genetic data. It has been my childhood dream to work at Oxford, and I am looking forward to doing cutting-edge research and meeting world-renowned scientists. <i class="fa fa-star"></i>
