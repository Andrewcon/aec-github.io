description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 4<sup>th</sup> most common type of cancer in the UK. Several risk factors have been identified, such as red meat consumption, obesity and smoking. Previous studies found that immune cell count levels are beneficial or detrimental based on the immune cell subtype. Using genetic data for CRC from a consortium called <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/public-health-sciences-division/research/cancer-prevention/genetics-epidemiology-colorectal-cancer-consortium-gecco.html">GECCO</a>, I am applying <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/32/1/1/642797">Mendelian randomization</a> to study the relationship between immune cell count subtypes and CRC.
