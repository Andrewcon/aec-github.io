description: <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a> is a 500K-participant study which has produced a lot of valuable healthcare research. However, most studies conducted using its data have been done in Europeans. This leaves out roughly 80K people who are not white British. Using several methods in population genetics, I have worked with members of my team to assign these people in continental ancestry groups corresponding to Europe, South Asia, East Asia and Africa. The aim of this project is to present a blueprint for future studies and aid future projects at my department.
