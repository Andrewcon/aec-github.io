description: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a clot in the deep veins of the leg. It is a potentially-life threatening disease which can progress to a pulmonary embolism, potentially leading to heart failure or death. Platelets are key in clot formation, and they have been involved in DVT development, although it is not known through which pathways they might act. To find potentially new pathways of DVT development linked to platelets, I conducted a Mendelian randomization study where I analysed ~2000 traits and their effect on DVT risk. I identified new risk factors for DVT, such as hyperthyroidism and varicose veins, and established risk factors, such as body mass index. Half of the risk factors I identified were adiposity-related, and I therefore investigated if proteins affected by adiposity influence the risk of developing DVT.
