description: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a life-threatening disease which comes with a great economic burden and potential loss of life. It is characterized by both an altered metabolism and hightened immune state. Several immune cell subtypes (e.g. neutrophil count) have been associated with an increased risk and mortality of T2D. I am using genetic data from the <a href="http://diagram-consortium.org/index.html">DIAGRAM</a> consortium to perform a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/32/1/1/642797">Mendelian randomization</a> analysis to study the relationship between immune cells in circulation and T2D. I am also looking at how immune cells might mediate the known link between T2D and colorectal cancer.
