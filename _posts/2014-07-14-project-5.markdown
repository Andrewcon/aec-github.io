description: Severe malaria caused by P. falciparum is mostly present in sub-Saharan Africa and comes with a great loss of life and economic development. People of African descent have lower average neutrophil counts compared to other populations. It is thought that this might provide a protective effect against severe malaria. I used African ancestry data from my 4<sup>th</sup> chapter to conduct a genome-wide association study of neutrophil count. I then performed a Mendelian randomization analysis between neutrophil counts and severe malaria subtypes <a href="https://www.malariagen.net/">(MalariaGEN)</a>.
