                        I am a 3rd year GW4BioMed PhD

                        My project is focused on the relationship between 
                        immune cell counts and disease.

                        I use R, Python and statistics to combine methods in 
                        population genetics and data science that 
                        allow me to conduct cutting-edge research. <i class="far fa-smile"></i>

                        Bristol is a great city to do a PhD in. 
                        It has a vibrant and diverse community, with many interesting and unique 
                        places to visit.

                        the projects I am working on during my trip to the outer 
                        boundaries of what is known in science.
